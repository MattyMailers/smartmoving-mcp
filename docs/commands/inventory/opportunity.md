## Failure modes

- Missing or invalid `SMARTMOVING_API_KEY` returns an auth/read failure.
- Basic-tier keys may receive `403 Forbidden` on Premium endpoints.
- Invalid UUIDs, missing required options, or invalid JSON input return validation/client errors.
- SmartMoving rate limits or transient API failures can return HTTP errors; retry cautiously and never duplicate writes without checking SmartMoving state.
